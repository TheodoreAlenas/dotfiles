I made a little PUML highlighting parser,
which isn't good at all and I made it
just for my personal needs back then.
It was before September 2023,
a month or two before that.

I'm leaving this message here
because I plan on uploading all these files
to GitHub and I'm not sure I'll include
the tree-sitter thing.
