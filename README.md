# System configuration

## About

From my videos you may have seen what I call,
as of October 4th 2023, `al/scmd.sh`
(system commands) and it's the inline shell
scripts that make up the key bindings.

As of now, ZSH and NeoVim are configured
in a way that's inspired by my
dash + Vi exercises. Dash is a minimal POSIX shell
where one can't for example paste the previous command.
Vi has no 'g', or 'q', and on my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@theodorealenas3171)
you can see a demonstration of what I learned form
the exercises.

## Assumed programs

- sxhkd
- bspwm
- picom
- dmenu
- lemonbar
- alacritty
- nvim
- zsh
- bash

I don't have Wayland.
The configuration of sxhkd is autogenerated by scmd.
I may include my dmenu twist here in the future.

## Trying it out

Don't. You can take ideas and look around.
You may take the individual components of the
base direcories of this repository
and link them to your system, after a backup.
But don't.
