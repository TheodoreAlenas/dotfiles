* Theodore's System Configuration

It's difficult to keep an up-to-date README, but as of now,
~install.sh~ symlinks the files in their respective directories
and ~scmd.sh~ is the system's command palette/hotkey configuration.
The shells share some of their configuration,
specifically there is a file with POSIX shell code that they both source.

An important part of the system is also the
[[https://github.com/TheodoreAlenas/widget-blink][clock and battery full screen popups]].
