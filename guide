Tricky!

From my videos you may have seen what I call,
as of October 4th 2023, al/scmd.sh
(system commands) and it's the inline shell
scripts that make up the key bindings.

Assumed programs:

sxhkd
bspwm
picom
dmenu
alacritty
nvim
zsh
bash

I don't have Wayland.
The configuration of sxhkd is autogenerated by scmd.
I may include my dmenu twist here in the future.
